This repository includes the data and R scripts to reproduce analyses and figures found in the article *Disturbances amplify tree community responses to climate change in the temperate-boreal ecotone* by Brice et al. in GEB.

Several steps required for data preparation can be found in the [Quebec_data repository](https://github.com/mhBrice/Quebec_data).
