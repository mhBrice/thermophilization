# thermophilization


This repository includes the data and R scripts to reproduce analyses and figures found in the article *Disturbances amplify tree community responses to climate change in the temperate-boreal ecotone* by Brice et al. in GEB.

Several steps required for data preparation can be found in the [Quebec_data repository](https://github.com/mhBrice/Quebec_data). These steps are necessary to run the scripts 1 and 2 (1_dataFormatting.R and 2_computeCTI.R). Scripts 1 and 2 format the data for the analyses performed in the scripts 3, 4 and 5, and these data are provided in the data folder.
