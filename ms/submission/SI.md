# Supplementary Figures

![](ms/figures/figS1_clim_trend.png){width=3in}

**Figure S1**. Temporal trends in growing season temperatures (top), total growing season precipitation (middle) and annual climate moisture index (bottom). Grey lines represent averaged climate values across all 6281 studied forest plots. Straight black lines show slope of least-squared linear regressions.

**Figure S3.** Species temporal changes for Québec forests and for each bioclimatic domain. Change in species occurrence (left) and species abundance (right). Only species occupying more than 20 plots are shown. The bars represent the mean change across the study area, while the colored points represent the mean change by domain. The stars represent the level of the significance of the p-value (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001) associated with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests used to determine whether individual species change in occurrence and abundance were significant. An increase in occurrence indicates that the species has spread regionally, while an increase in abundance indicates that the species has spread locally and/or regionally. Letters next to species names correspond to (T)emperate; (P)ioneer
and (B)oreal species.

**Figure S4**. Triangle diagram of gains and losses in tree abundance by bioclimatic domains and disturbance levels. Each point represents a forest plot and the large black point represents the centroid. At the upper tip of the triangle, similarity is high (ß = 0; blue colors). At the base of the triangle, dissimilarity is high (ß = 1). On the left, forests in red are dominated by losses (red colors), while on the right, forests in green are dominated by gains (green colors). The similar distributions of gain and loss values in the ternary diagrams suggests that there is no major difference in temporal ß diversity patterns among domains.
