## Biosketch

Marie-Hélène Brice is a Ph.D. candidate at Université de Montréal. She is
interested in the natural and anthropogenic processes that structure
biodiversity spatially and temporally, with a special interest for vegetation.
She uses taxonomic and functional approaches to understand the link between the
ongoing global change and community reorganization.
